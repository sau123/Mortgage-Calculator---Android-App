Description : The purpose of this assignment to understand the basics of Android Development. I have implemented the 
assignment using fragments, where the input and the output screen are different fragments. The apk works on Nexus 10 too. 
I have provided all validations including if the input value is a decimal and not a String or a negative number. Another 
validation that I have provided is that the down payment should not be greater than the home value.


Instruction to run the application : Open the project using Android Studio. You will need an emulator to run the android application.
